# Designing Machine Learning Systems - Chip Huyen

I am currently reading through this book and these are my up-to-date notes for the book.


# High Overview Summary

This book takes a holistic approach to ML systems, as it takes into account all the different components of the system and the objectives of different stakeholders involved. 

# Who is this book for?

Anyone who wants to leverage ML to solve real-world problems!
This book focuses on teaching how one should use deep learning and classical algorithms (slightly inclined towards ML systems at scale such as those seen at medium-to-large entrepreisses and fast-growing startups).

> **_NOTE:_**  Readers without strong tech backgrounds would benefit the most from Chapters 1, 2, 11


# What this book is not

This book is not an introduction to ML
Some topics that you should be already familiar with prior entering this book should be:
- ML models such as clustering, logistic regression, decision trees, collaborative filtering, and various neural network architectures including feed-forward, recurrent, convolutional, and transformer
- ML techniques such as supervised versus unsupervised, gradient descent, objective/loss function, regularization, generalization, and hyperparameter tuning
- Metrics such as accuracy, F1, precision, recall, ROC, mean squared error, and log-likelihood
- Statistical concepts such as variance, probability, and normal/long-tail distribution
- Common ML tasks such as language modeling, anomaly detection, object classification, and machine translation

Now, it is important to keep in mind that technologies evolve over time! 
However, while tools go in/out of style quickly, the fundamental appraoches to problem solving often lasts.

Hence, this book provides a framework for you to evaluate the tool that works best for your personal use case

# Navigating this Book

This book is structured to reflect the problems data scientists might encounter as they progress through the lifecycle of an ML project.

1. Chapters 1 and 2 lay down the groundwork to set an ML project up for success
    - It focuses on answering the most basic questions of -> Does your project need ML? , How to frame your problem in a way that makes for simpler solutions?

2. Chapters 4, 5, 6 cover the pre-deployment phase of an ML project: from creating the training data and engineering features to developing and evaluating your models in a development environment.

3. Chapters 7, 8, 9 cover the deployment and post-deployment phase of an ML project. 
    - The deployed model will need to be monitored and continually updated to changing environments and business requirements.

4. Chatpers 3 and 10 focus on the infrastructure needed to enable stakeholders from different backgrounds to work together to deliver successful ML systems
    - Chapter 3 focuses on data systems
    - Chapter 10 focuses on compute infrastructure and ML platforms

5. Chapter 11 focuses ML systems' impact on society
