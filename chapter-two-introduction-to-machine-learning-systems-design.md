# Introduction to Machine Learning Systems Design

## High Level Overview of the Chapter

Re-iterating from the first chapter, ML systems design takes a system appraoch to MLOps
>:bulb: MLOps is an ML culture and practice that unifies ML application development (Dev) with ML system deployment and operations (Ops).

In general, there are four requirements that guide the developement of the ML system:
1. Reliability
2. Scalability
3. Maintainability
4. Adaptability


Now, before designing a ML algorithm to solve a problem, the primary important thing is to **frame the problem into a task that ML can solve**. This will be talked in this chapter


Lastly, the last part of this chapter touches on a debate that has consumed much of the ML literature in recent years: which is more important—data or intelligent algorithms?

## Key Takeaways








## Business and ML Objectives

### What is causing short-lived ML projects?
Here is something that needs to be addressed straight out:
>:small_red_triangle_down: most companies don’t care about the fancy ML metrics..... unless it moves some business metrics

A pattern common in many short-lived ML projects is that the data scientists become too focused on hacking ML metrics without paying attention to business metrics

As ML engineers, we should keep in mind that:
- The ultimate goal of any project within a business is **to increase profits**, either directly or indirectly 
For an ML project to succeed within a business organization, it’s crucial to tie the performance of an ML system to the overall business performance. What business performance metrics is the new ML system supposed to influence, e.g., the amount of ads revenue, the number of monthly active users?
