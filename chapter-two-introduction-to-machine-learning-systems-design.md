# Introduction to Machine Learning Systems Design

## High Level Overview of the Chapter

Re-iterating from the first chapter, ML systems design takes a system appraoch to MLOps
>:bulb: MLOps is an ML culture and practice that unifies ML application development (Dev) with ML system deployment and operations (Ops).

In general, there are four requirements that guide the developement of the ML system:
1. Reliability
2. Scalability
3. Maintainability
4. Adaptability


Now, before designing a ML algorithm to solve a problem, the primary important thing is to **frame the problem into a task that ML can solve**. This will be talked in this chapter


Lastly, the last part of this chapter touches on a debate that has consumed much of the ML literature in recent years: which is more importantâ€”data or intelligent algorithms?
