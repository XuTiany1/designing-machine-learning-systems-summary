# High level overview of chapter

Ok.
Quickly.
When I tell you 'machine learning system', what do you think of?
Well, most people (like me when I was reading this book) automatically connects with specific ML algorithms that can be used such as:
- Logistic regression
- Neural nets

However.
Algorithm is only a small part of ML system in production!

Just to name a few, other critical aspects of the system would also be:
1. business requirements, that gave birth to the ML project in the first place
2. interface where users and developers interact with system
3. data stack
4. logic for developing, monitoring, and updating models
5. infrasstructure that enables the delivery of said logic


## Structure of chapter 1
The first chapter of the book aims to give you an overview of what it takes to bring an ML model to production
